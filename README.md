Building an IoT-enabled bike rack for the Cantina office.

## design goals

Several of us prefer to commute to and from work via bicycle. We don't have a secure place to store our bikes during the day, so we need to build/install a bike rack.

And if we are going to go to the trouble of doing that, we might as well make it smart object, and hook it up to the web. After all, we are a tech company with a special interest in the user experince of smart objects and the Internet of Things.

## Features

* check availability of rack slots remotely
* check status of bikes in the slots, i.e., "is my bike still here?"
* download bike odometer info to track miles biked in our company dashboard
